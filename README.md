> [When shooting is taking place, it will be under the control of a Field Captain who will indicate when it is safe to shoot, but every archer can play a part in this. If you see anything that gives a cause for concern, then call out ‚ÄúFAST‚Äù and all shooting will cease, even if an archer is at full draw they must let down the bow and wait.](http://bowmenofardleigh.com/shooting/glossary-of-archery-terms/#:~:text=SAFETY,on%20the%20bow.)

Many coaches recommend keeping a diary of your shoots, recording what has gone well, what mistakes were made and so on.
In Fast you can record notes as you shoot, and then later review them in the diary. You can highlight a note just by
tapping it.

Rotating your phone will show you the full scorecard, automatically calculated. It correctly follows the rules around
gold counts and Xs depending on the round you are shooting.

## Tech waffle

- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.

Whilst I am a huge [HTMX](https://quii.dev/HTMX_is_the_Future) fan, for this I wanted a static website, so that I wouldn't have to pay for a database, and I can keep the hosting cheap. I also wanted to try out Vue, so this was a good opportunity to do so. 

It's been a lot of fun, the event system and reactivity is simple and I find it more intuitive than React. If I were to start a project where I knew I'd need something very client-side heavy, which wouldn't be appropriate for HTMX, I'd definitely consider Vue.
